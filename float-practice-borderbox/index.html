			<h1>How to Remove Emotional Blocks</h1>
		</header>

		<div class='col'>
			<h2>1. What do you want?</h2>
			<p>
			What is it you want? What do you feel frustrated over that you've been experiencing in your life for a long time now. Usually our recurring issues are a good place to start when looking for things that we want to change. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class='col'>
			<h2>2. What is in the way?</h2>
			<p>
			Sometimes it's hard to know what is in our way. For this one, take your best guess. You can always go back and change your answer if you found something that feels more true. Example: "my current coping mechanisms are in the way" or  "my anger is in the way."
			</p>
		</div>

<div class='col'>
			<h2>3. Who is in the way?</h2>
			<p>
			For this one, you have to really go with your gut. Who do you think of that is connected to this conflict inside yourself. What event does it remind you of and who was involved in that event of your life. It could be muliple people. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class='col'>
			<h2>4. What happened?</h2>
			<p>
			This is where you have to dig deep and think about an event that maybe was maybe a tramatic experience for you. Explain it from your perspective now. Sometimes it helps to talk through what happened from your perspective and then from a 'fly on the wall' perspective. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class='col'>
			<h2>5. How did you feel?</h2>
			<p>
			Explore the emotions you experienced during that event. Did you feel alone? Misunderstood? Humiliated? Explore all of it and really dig deep and embrace those feelings even though they are uncomfortable. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class='col'>
			<h2>6. What do you want to happen now?</h2>
			<p>
			Now that you know what you know, and have had a chance to process a little, what do you want to do now? It could be as simple as "I want to just forgive and move on."
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class='col'>
			<h2>7. Forgive.</h2>
			<p>
			This is where you write out your forgiveness. Forgive everyone involed, including yourself. Forgive yourself for what you did not know at the time and reacting the way you did. It's ok to make mistakes and we need to let ourselves as well as others off the hook. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class='col'>
			<h2>8. What is the lesson?</h2>
			<p>
			This seems like a no brainer but it's often a step we skip if we don't intentionally think about it. One of the most redeeming things about mistakes or trauma or misfortunes in our life is that there is always something we can learn from it. Sit and think about it for a while. A good prompt question is: "what will I do different in the future?"
